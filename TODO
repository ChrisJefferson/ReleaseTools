* make-dist
  - make sure Mercurial support still works
  - add support for further VCS, like Bazaar?

* upload
  - upload release tarballs to GitHub via GitHub API v3. There are many
    libraries for these APIs, see http://developer.github.com/libraries/
    There is an official binding for Ruby: octokit.rb
    For Perl, these look interesting:
      https://github.com/fayland/perl-net-github
      https://github.com/plu/Pithub
  - also support other upload methods, e.g. via FTP, SCP, rsync, ...?
  - support BitBucket downloads?! Do they even offer an API for that?

* improve
