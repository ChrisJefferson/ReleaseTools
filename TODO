* documentation
  - completely document everything

* make-dist
  - make sure Mercurial support still works
  - add support for further VCS, like Bazaar or Subversion?
  - right now, after building the manual with `gap -A makedoc.g`,
    we manually remove various auxiliary files like `doc/*.aux`.
    It would be better to improve GAPDoc to either not build the
    manual inside the doc dir, or to cleanup after itself.
    At least optionally.
  - add command line options to change which archive formats
    to build. Even better, automatically detect this from
    the `ArchiveFormats` field in `PackageInfo.g`.

* upload
  - improve usability
  - allow also "--repo USER/REPO"?
  - support other upload methods, e.g. via FTP, SCP, rsync, ...?
  - support BitBucket downloads?! Do they even offer an API for that?

* possibly allow users to add a .release-config file to
  their repositories which stores various release relevant
  settings, e.g. the upload method (github release system? FTP server
  and path? etc.)
  Alternatively, store these things in PackageInfo.g?
